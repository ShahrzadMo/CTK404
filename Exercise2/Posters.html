   <p>The Federal Art Project (FAP) was created in 1935 to provide work relief for artists<br>
     in various media--painters, sculptors, muralists and graphic artists, with various levels of experience.<br>
     Holger Cahill, a curator and fine and folk art expert, was appointed director of the program.<br>
     As with the other Federal cultural projects of the time, the program sought to bring art and artists into<br>
     the everyday life of communities throughout the United States, through community art centers, exhibitions<br>
     and classes.<br>
     The Federal Art Project was just one of several government-sponsored art programs of the period.<br>
     Others included the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) (1933-34), the Department of the Treasury's Section<br>
     of Painting and Scultpure (1934-42; renamed the Section of Fine Arts in 1938), and its Treasury Relief Art Project<br>
     (TRAP) (1935-38).</p>
